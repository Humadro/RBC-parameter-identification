  abstract = {We discuss prior elicitation for the parameters of dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) models, and provide a method for constructing prior distributions for a subset of these parameters from beliefs about steady-state relationships and second moments of the endogenous variables. The empirical application documents how the specification of the prior distribution affects our assessment of the relative importance of price and wage rigidities in a New Keynesian DSGE model.},

  author = {{Guerr{\'o}n-Quintana}, Pablo A and Nason, James M},
  abstract = {This chapter surveys Bayesian methods for estimating dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) models. We focus on New Keynesian (NK)DSGE models because of the ongoing interest shown in this class of models by economists in academic and policy-making institutions. Their interest stems from the ability of this class of DSGE model to transmit monetary policy shocks into endogenous fluctuations at business cycle frequencies. Intuition about this propagation mechanism is developed by reviewing the structure of a canonical NKDSGE model. Estimation and evaluation of the NKDSGE model rests on detrending its optimality and equilibrium conditions to construct a linear approximation of the model from which we solve for its linear decision rules. This solution is mapped into a linear state space model. It allows us to run the Kalman filter generating predictions and updates of the detrended state and control variables and the predictive likelihood of the linear approximate NKDSGE model. The predictions, updates, and likelihood are inputs needed to operate the Metropolis-Hastings Markov chain Monte Carlo sampler from which we draw the posterior distribution of the NKDSGE model. The sampler also requires the analyst to pick priors for the NKDSGE model parameters and initial conditions to start the sampler. We review pseudo-code that implements this sampler before reporting estimates of a canonical NKDSGE model across samples that begin in 1982Q1 and end in 2019Q4, 2020Q4, 2021Q4, and 2022Q4. The estimates are compared across the four samples. This survey also gives a short history of DSGE model estimation as well as pointing to issues that are at the frontier of this research agenda.},

We derive such equations for three fundamental objects of economic dynamics -- lifetime reward functions, Bellman equations and Euler equations. We estimate the decision functions on simulated data using a stochastic gradient descent method. We introduce an all-in-one integration operator that facilitates approximation of high-dimensional integrals. We use neural networks to perform model reduction and to handle multicollinearity. Our deep learning method is tractable in large-scale problems, e.g., Krusell and Smith (1998). We provide a TensorFlow code that accommodates a variety of applications.},

  abstract = {Using a Bayesian likelihood approach, we estimate a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model for the US economy using seven macroeconomic time series. The model incorporates many types of real and nominal frictions and seven types of structural shocks. We show that this model is able to compete with Bayesian Vector Autoregression models in out-of-sample prediction. We investigate the relative empirical importance of the various frictions. Finally, using the estimated model, we address a number of key issues in business cycle analysis: What are the sources of business cycle fluctuations? Can the model explain the cross correlation between output and inflation? What are the effects of productivity on hours worked? What are the sources of the "Great Moderation"?
